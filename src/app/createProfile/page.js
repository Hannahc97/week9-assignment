// Your user should only be able to access this page once they have been redirected from the sign-up part 

// We need a form so the user can enter their user profile data!
// Maybe you will make some of your form required, or keeping the submitted data valid. 

// We need a SQL query to insert that data into a table (preferrably the users table)

// Think about what you would expect to happen next as a user! 
// Maybe you get shown your completed profile page and there is a link that takes you to the "view all posts" page?
// Maybe you get redirected automaically to that app.
